The Text Justification algorithm will ensure that the output from
your program is both left and right justified when displayed in a
mono-spaced font  such as Courier. This paragraph is an example
of such  justification. All the lines (except the last) of the
output from a given run of your program should have the same
length, and the last line is to be no longer than the other
lines.
